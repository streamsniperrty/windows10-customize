# Custom Windows 10

My custom build of Windows 10

### Prerequisites

* Install the font ![**Iosevka**](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases) from here.
* Change the taskbar location from the bottom to the top.
* Change the accent colors to your liking.
* In the `photos` folder, I have provided two background pictures that you are welcome to use. Of course, you are welcome to use your own background wallpapers. In my setup, I use the wallpapers provided.
* If you want, enable dark mode.
* If you want, you can install the ![**Choclatey Package Manager**](https://chocolatey.org/install) from here.
* To execute the script, change the Group Policy to Unrestricted. Type in the following command (running PowerShell Admin), `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`. This will allow you to execute any PowerShell script.

### Installation

Begin by cloning this repository into your Downloads folder. I recommend that you copy the files `changeFont.reg`, `changeVolumeSlider.reg`, and `script.ps1` from the repository and paste it directly into your Downloads folder. Open up PowerShell running as admin in that directory and type in `.\script.ps1`. Make sure to click Yes to all the prompts.

### Final Product

The final product should look something like this:
